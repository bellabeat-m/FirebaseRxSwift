📌  Steps in setting up git project on your local machine

![alt tag](https://img.shields.io/badge/git%20-Config%20project-blue)

1. Clone a repo from Github
2. Create a git SSH key and paste it into Github -> Setting -> SSH & GPG keys
3. Set up your global and local config file as needed: add username and email for USER-
```shell
        [user] 
	name = marko markic 
	email = xx@xx.xx "
```
	
4. Download in app content framework from submodule in terminal

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
5. Update Carthage
```shell
carthage bootstrap --platform iOS --use-ssh
```
(Later for faster builds, use flag)
```shell
carthage bootstrap --platform iOS --use-ssh --cache-builds
```

📌  Common practice: ```merge``` when bigger and longer features, for all other cases use ```rebase```

### How to Rebase it via Sourcetree?
This was a process of customising Sourcetree for more console output.

✖️ make sure you are Rebasing on your Feature branch

1. Checkout to branch you want to Rebase
2. Move to the feature branch you want to take, and go to the LAST commit (like the image)
3. Right-click and choose REBASE, not Rebase children...

4. If there are conflict you will be blocked (if you do not see the Sourcetree messages log, enable them in Preference -> Advanced).
   Solve Conflicts by external tools, editors or Xcode
5. Back in Sourcetree history check commits, and click again on the same feature branch as on the start of rebase (step 3)
6. Right click there choose again REBASE, will ask to Continue Rebase
7. You should see changes from your to MASTER, Force Push in source tree to remote (picture bellow to allow this)
7. Go to github project and create the Pull request for the rebase.Set up members to approve/rejec
8. Once there are comments change the projects files and repeat REBASE to solve conflicts if there are any
9. Once that is all approved merge your Feature branch to Master and delete it

You will need to enable FORCE PUSH in Preference-Advanced-Allow Force Push
